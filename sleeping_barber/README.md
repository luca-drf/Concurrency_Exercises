Sleeping Barber Problem
=======================
From Wikipedia:

> The barber has one barber chair and a waiting room with a number of chairs in
> it. When the barber finishes cutting a customer's hair, he dismisses the
> customer and then goes to the waiting room to see if there are other customers
> waiting. If there are, he brings one of them back to the chair and cuts his
> hair. If there are no other customers waiting, he returns to his chair and
> sleeps in it.
